This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on twitter feeds to identify news that could change the odds of a match result. This will need to identify both teams and players to determine which markets to choose. For example, Bukayo Saka receives an injury before Arsenal v Aston Villa, this model needs to understand that Saka is important for the Arsenal team, so the odds for Arsenal to win the game might shorten.
